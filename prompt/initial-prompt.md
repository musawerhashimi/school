Hey claude.
i have a project i want to work using react ts + tailwind and django drf
for frontend i want to use react query, axios, zod, react-hook-form, zustand (if needed) and others.


it is an school system which has the public website content for advertising and social communication, and management part which has scheduals, attendance, teacher student parent portals and other things.

it will have different languages which rtl and ltr in the future so make use of start and end instead of left and right.

school name: Sultan Zoy High School

first i want to make the front end public website content which is relatively easier.

i want you to generate some of the parts of the project with beautiful UI/UX and typed functions and components.

***************
structure pattern:
theming: generally i want two theme: dark and light, and for colors if you want to use a color instead of directly using it like bg-red-200 or text-blue-200 and if that color doesn't exist in below color values, define color variables. first give me the color var names and its values like this:
  card-color: white
  background: #1201ef

and then use them like this in classes.
bg-background or  text-card-color and other like this (JUST LIKE THIS NO OTHER WAY, YOU DO NOT USE LIKE text-var(--color-card-color) OR ANY OTHER WAY, JUST THE WAY I TOLD).

these are the existing colors i am using. you can use them like that or if you want to add new color variables just follow the above rules, and don't worry about how it works. 

@theme {
  /* Brand */
